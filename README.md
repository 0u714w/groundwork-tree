# Groundwork - React Tree Assessment

Create a recursive descending tree UI component in React, [as seen in the demo video](https://bestquote.notion.site/Fullstack-Software-Engineer-Assessments-a0b4e26008284491bbfc7562d5f59b8c). Strong preference will given to react, and this repository has been set up for that purpose, but solutions will be accepted in any framework, including vanilla JS. Style the component however you would like.

Fork this repo and edit [src/App.js](/src/App.js) to get started!

## Requirements

- Child nodes should be able to be created “on enter” of a text input as seen in the example video.
- The component should be capable of accepting a default value as a prop. Example default data structure shown in [the assessment document](https://bestquote.notion.site/Fullstack-Software-Engineer-Assessments-a0b4e26008284491bbfc7562d5f59b8c), (but please design however you see fit):
- Hosted publicly on Github Pages. See directions below.

## Deploying to Github Pages

Simply edit the "homepage" attribute on in the [package.json](/package.json) with something like `"https://{your-github-username}.github.io/{repo-name}"` and run `npm run deploy` in your terminal.

Visit the **Settings** tab inside your forked github repo. Navigate to **Pages** from the left side nav. Select **"Deploy from a branch"** under **Build and Deployment**. Select **"gh-pages"** as the branch and **"/(root)"** as the folder.

After a moment your App should live at the homepage you designated.
